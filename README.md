# ChatCRM

An omnichannel inbox and CRM demo for laundry and salon businesses. ChatCRM combines a WhatsApp-style conversation workspace with customer segmentation (RFM), order cadence predictions, and a Salesforce-inspired permission model — all in a single web app.

Built with **TanStack Start**, **React 19**, and **TypeScript**. Data is stored in-memory for demo purposes; no external database is required.

---

## Features

### Inbox & CRM
- **Unified chat inbox** with conversation filters (mine, unassigned, open, resolved, snoozed)
- **Customer directory** with table/card views, search, and RFM segment filters
- **Customer detail** with purchase history, notes, tags, cadence override, and manual record sharing
- **Quick-reply templates**, conversation tags, snooze, and transfer workflows

### Analytics
- **RFM segmentation** — Champions, Loyal, Promising, At Risk, New, Dormant
- **CLV estimation** — 12-month projected customer lifetime value
- **Order cadence engine** — predicts next order date from purchase patterns (with manual override)
- **Supervisor dashboard** — segment distribution charts, monthly spending trends, follow-up queues, team performance

### Security & Governance
- **Role-based access control** — CS, Supervisor, and Owner roles with 30 granular permissions
- **Record-level sharing** — manual share with view/edit permission and optional expiry
- **Field visibility rules** — phone number masking for CS agents
- **Audit log** — filterable activity trail with role-scoped visibility
- **Export approval workflow** — supervisors request exports; owners approve or deny

## Routes

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `/` | Demo login — pick an agent to explore role-based access |
| `/dashboard` | Overview KPIs, RFM charts, cadence follow-up (supervisor/owner) |
| `/chat` | Omnichannel inbox |
| `/chat/:customerId` | Inbox with a conversation pre-selected |
| `/customers` | Customer CRM with filters, detail modal, and sharing |
| `/settings` | Profile, team, templates, audit log, export, and billing |

## Business Logic

### RFM Segmentation

Customers are scored on **Recency**, **Frequency**, and **Monetary** value (1–5 each), then mapped to one of six segments. Scoring thresholds and segment rules live in `src/lib/rfm.ts`.

### Order Cadence

Purchase history is analyzed to compute average days between orders, a human-readable cadence label (daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, irregular), and a predicted next order date. CS agents and supervisors can set a manual cadence override per customer.

### Permissions

Permissions are declared in `src/lib/permissions.ts`. Key helpers:

- `hasPermission(role, permission)` — check a single permission
- `canAccessCustomer(agent, customer)` — CS sees assigned, unassigned, and shared records
- `canEditCustomer(agent, customer)` — respects manual share edit grants
- `canViewAuditEntry(viewerRole, …)` — supervisors cannot see owner-only audit entries

---

## Demo Mode Notes

This is a **frontend demo** with seeded data:

- All state resets on page refresh (in-memory store, no persistence)
- Reference date for RFM/CLV calculations is fixed at **2026-06-18** for consistent demo output
- WhatsApp integration is simulated — messages are mock data, not live API calls
- Billing and some workflow settings are UI placeholders
